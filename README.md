# Skypecon

A library enabling the [Skypecon](http://demoive.github.io/skypecon) catalog site to showcase all the Skype icons in their full, native quality. The usage is web-friendly and leverages all the webby things we love like CSS for animations, retina support, etc.

<!--
## Roadmap
The roadmap can be seen in [Trello](https://trello.com/b/E80u7hbd/skypecon).

## Features

- Retina support
- Different animation speeds
- Animated and non-animated versions
- Efficient bandwidth and GPU usage with CSS sprites
-->

## Usage

You're better off [playing around with the different options](http://demoive.github.io/skypecon/). But if you want some documentation, here ya go: define an HTML `<i>` tag with a class of `sc` and _one_ `sc-[icon]` type. Then alter its behavior with _at most one_ option from each set:

- **Animation**
  - `sc-hover` - only animate on hover
  - `sc-still` - prevents the animation (will override `sc-hover`)

- **Animation speed**
  - `sc-slow` - Reduces to ~20fps
  - `sc-fast` - Increases to ~40fps

- **Size**
  - `sc-2x` - Shows the icon at twice the size (40px). Has no effect on retina screens.
  - `sc-4x` - Coming soon


## Notice

This library was created with the utmost respect for the people responsible for the icons at Skype and exists to properly showcase their work (while allowing some flexibility in its demonstration as well).

There are many sites around the web that also catalog the emoticons and flags that are available in Skype, (especially for the popular hidden ones), however, none show the icons in their best potential quality (both in resolution and smoothness in the animation) of how they are shown within the Skype application. Not to mention they aren't driven by the community and don't appear easy to maintain or to scale well.


## Skype plug

The Skype team really hits a sweet spot in the set of icons they offer, achieving all of the following:

1. accurate expression/emotion captured ([avoids miscommojication](http://grouplens.org/blog/investigating-the-potential-for-miscommunication-using-emoji/)) 
2. sufficient variety
3. appropriate animations
4. correct level of "cuteness"

I think other emoticons available today fail in at least one of these criteria. The [Emoji](http://www.emoji-cheat-sheet.com/) set is popular but doesn't offer animation and has an over-whelming number of options. For example, I feel the following emotions don't warrant different icons:

- **tongue**: :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes: :stuck_out_tongue: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
- **kiss**: :kissing: :kissing_smiling_eyes: :kissing_closed_eyes: :kissing_heart:
- **smile**: :smile: :smiley: :grinning: :relieved: :grimacing: :grin:
- **laughing**: :laughing: :satisfied:
- **worried**: :worried: :persevere:
- **surprised**: :anguished: :frowning: :dizzy_face: :open_mouth: :hushed:
- **indifferent**: :neutral_face: :expressionless: :confused:
- **cry**: :sob: :cry: :sweat: :tired_face: :confounded: :weary: :cold_sweat: :disappointed_relieved: :sleepy:
- **sad**: :pensive: :disappointed:


<!--
The [Phantom Open Emoji](https://github.com/Genshin/PhantomOpenEmoji) is promising. This library offers a great framework for using their work on the web.
